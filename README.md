# ProcurePro backend technical challenge

[![ProcurePro](/public/images/procurepro-logo.png)](https://procurepro.co)


## Overview

This challenge is designed to accomplish three things:

1. Give you a basic understanding of our tools, domain, abstractions and how we write code
2. Give us an understanding of how you work and if you'll be comfortable in our stack
3. Give us both something to discuss in the next interview

## Expectations

While we would love you to do a great job of this challenge, we are certainly mindful and respectful of your time.

You should only spend _an hour or two_ on this challenge. It's ok if you don't finish all the tasks. We can both still
get a good understanding of each other, and it will definitely give us something to discuss in the interview.

We are not trying to test your knowledge of PHP or Symfony. We've provided a project that's ready to go, with plenty
of examples for what is required. Additionally, anything PHP/Symfony specific will be easily found on Google, they have
excellent documentation.

Depending on your seniority, we will be looking for different things.

For a __junior__ we're looking for:

- The attitude you approach the problem with
- Do you have a growth mindset?
- How do you understand and break down a problem?
- What do you google?
- How do you ask questions?

For a more __senior__ engineer, we'll be looking at:

- How you architect the solution
- What trade-offs do you make and why
- How would you expand or improve this given more time?

For __everyone__, we would expect you to:

- Blend into our existing code style
- Write tests
- Attempt to satisfy the static analysis (we know this can be hard!).

## Getting started

This is a straight forward PHP and Symfony project. All you'll need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and an IDE,
and you'll be up and running in less than 10 minutes.

1. Have a read of [Our concepts](/doc/concepts.md) to familiarise yourself with our tools and basic abstractions.
2. Follow the [Setup guide](/doc/setup.md) to get up and running
3. Take on the [Challenge](/doc/task.md)

## About us

[ProcurePro](https://procurepro.co) is on a mission to __transform construction procurement__, helping
__the global industry__ become __truly exceptional__. Our market leading technology helps major builders contract with
their supply chain by consolidating fragmented and manual processes into a single platform (currently solved by Word,
Excel & email).

### Our Product-Led strategy

We’re Founded by Developers and Designers (as well as domain experts) - technical excellence is in our DNA. This means:

- We spend time up front properly designing new work, testing with customers etc., whilst solving fun technical problems.
- We continually invest in testing/quality - we’ve written 10,000+ automated tests in the last 2 years, we're huge
  advocates for static analysis & type safety, and our infrastructure is automated with Terraform.
- Our entire team (including our CEO) is bought into this mindset, as we're reaping the rewards of shipping quality
  code, avoiding re-work & moving fast as a team.

In addition to building/shipping/maintaining the product, you will provide feedback and direction during the shaping and
design processes of new features/changes with the entire team (dev, design, product lead, users), work
closely/collaboratively and problems solve with the others in the dev team including mentoring junior developers.

### Values we live by

1. Better people build better companies
2. Whole arse it, with ruthless pragmatism
3. Help the customer win

(You'll learn more about these during our interview process)

### Our culture

- **Team First** - we’re close-knit, highly collaborative, actively help each other succeed (knowledge sharing,
  training) to develop our teams’ capabilities
- **High Expectations** - we’re self-motivated, embrace velocity as our greatest advantage, take pride in what we do and
  push to reach our potential.
- **Radical Transparency** - we believe in flat structures & sharing knowledge, everyone is privy to what happens
  day-to-day and nothing is hidden (i.e. company strategy, finances & all).
- **Remote First** - work from anywhere in Australia - we were remote-first before Covid, have established processes
  around collaboration/culture to ensure inclusiveness & engagement. We have social events & annual off-sites (in
  person).
